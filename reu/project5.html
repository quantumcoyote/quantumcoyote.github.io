											<p align="justify"> Students new to computational studies in materials science face a significant learning curve as they must familiarize themselves with high performance computing (HPC), learn the fundamental principles behind their research, while at the same time perform and analyze their calculations. The challenges associated with HPC use can be reduced by hands-on training sessions as well as by designing a project that involves only one software package; however, establishing an environment that eases the learning process without constant supervision is more challenging. Most undergraduate students struggle to find scientific resources that gradually introduce them to the steps that one should take in answering their research questions. For example, in a computational project to identify the origin of an experimental spectroscopic feature, the student not only has to focus on his/her research question but also understand, for example, which computational method, basis set, integral accuracy, plane-wave cutoff, number of k points, etc. is the most suitable to optimize the X-ray structure and calculate the desired spectra. Often the solutions are available online, but they are scattered among multiple sites and/or bibliographic sources and require students to have the vocabulary of an advanced user to find them quickly. Therefore, our goal is to develop a query based tool that allows novice researchers to address their questions more efficiently.</p>
											<p align="justify"> The Bioscience Query Tool Discovery Systems (<a href="http://biotds.org"> Bio-TDS </a>) was developed in Dr. Lushbough's group in collaboration with Dr. Etienne Gnimpieba to help investigate similar problems in bioinformatics and computational biology. Bio-TDS is a flexible retrieval system allowing users to query over 15,000 analytic tool descriptions integrated from well-established, community repositories. Analytic tools are annotated and curated using an ontology and natural language processing workflow. Bio-TDS offers researchers the capacity to associate their science question with the most relevant computational toolsets required for the data analysis in their knowledge discovery process. Queries can be entered using a drop-down list or posed in natural language. Bio-TDS was strongly oriented towards bioinformatics and computational biology; however, it can be easily adapted to other scientific research areas such as computational materials science.The specific objective of this project is to develop protocols to streamline the research performed by undergraduate students. This will be achieved through the creation of Docker images for requisite analytic tools and workflows associated with the computational materials science projects.</p>
