											<h1>Multilevel Catalytic Study of the Acetalization of Benzaldehydes in Metal-Organic Frameworks</h1>

											<p align="justify">Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of organometallic materials that consist of metal nodes with one or more metal center connected via an organic ligand (often called a linker) in a porous 3D topology. These materials are highly promising in many chemical processes such as gas storage, separations, and sensing due to their high porosity and thermal stability as well as their broad chemical and structural tunability. However, the application of MOFs in catalysis is an emerging field, and the number of computational studies of catalytic processes inside of MOFs remains small. Moreover, computational studies that have been accomplished commonly neglect the MOF environment by modeling only the active site (cluster model) with quantum mechanical calculations. This approach is generally able to properly describe the reaction mechanism, but since it neglects confinement effects in the MOF's pores and channels, which leads to a very poor description of reaction rates, yields, and product ratios. In consequence, the predictive capability of computational studies is very limited as they often cannot explain the effect of the MOF itself or predict the effect of the local concentration of reactants on the studied catalytic process.</p>

<p align="justify"> In this project, we will study the acetalization of benzaldehyde inside a family of zirconium-based iso-reticular MOFs (IRMOFs) with different nitrogenated linkers that catalyze the reaction (Figure 1). This reaction has a well-established mechanism and accurate reaction kinetics have been measured inside IRMOFs. We propose a multilevel approach where the adsorption/desorption of reactants, intermediates, and products in the MOF materials will be modeled with classical Monte Carlo simulations, while quantum mechanics will be used to explore the energetics of the reaction. The results of such calculations will then be used to create a microkinetic model able to include the effects of confinement and local concentration into the energetics of the reaction derived from quantum mechanical calculations.</p>
